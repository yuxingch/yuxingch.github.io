In summer 2019, I received an M.S. in [Symbolic Systems Program](https://symsys.stanford.edu) at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu), advised by [Judith Degen](https://sites.google.com/site/judithdegen/) in the Department of [Linguistics](https://linguistics.stanford.edu) at Stanford. My research focuses on natural language processing, computational linguistics, and pragmatic inferences involved in language production and comprehension.

Prior to my study at Stanford, I was an undergraduate student majoring [Applied Mathematics](https://www.math.ucla.edu) and [Linguistics and Computer Science](https://linguistics.ucla.edu) at [University of California, Los Angeles](http://www.ucla.edu).
